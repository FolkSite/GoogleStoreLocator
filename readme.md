Proximity search of Stores based on the Google API.

The "Google Store Locator" enables a proximity search for your stores/locations on your MODX-Site. Find and filter Stores/Locations by distance and provide users to find the closest store/location of their current position or address. GoogleStoreLocator can be easily integrated into your website and is fully customizable by chunks and styles. Just install it via the Package-Manager and place the snippet-call in your "Store-Finder" Site-Template. Place the Placeholders for the Store-List, Map and Search-Form wherever you want them to appear.


To add a store/location, simply add the GoogleStoreLocator TVs to your Store-Template or define custom Tvs for the address and add a new Resource as a new Store/Location. Create the Store-Resources as childs of your Stores-Search-Site or set the Parent-IDs with the "&parents" property. After creating a new Resource/Store clear the cache.
Now your new Store should show up in your List.

Have fun and enjoy the extra. Please report bugs via email or Github.
